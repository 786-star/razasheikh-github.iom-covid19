        The COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
        by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached
        Pakistan on 26 February 2020, when a student in Karachi tested positive upon returning from Iran.[2] By 18
        March, cases had been registered in all four provinces, the two autonomous territories, and the federal
        territory of Islamabad.[3]

        As of 3 July 2020, there have been about 217,800 confirmed cases with 104,700 recoveries and 4,470 deaths in the
        country. Sindh has recorded the most cases at over 86,800, while Punjab has reported the most deaths in the
        country, a total of 1,784.[1] The country was put under a nation-wide lockdown until 9 May,[4] which was
        initiated on 1 April and later extended twice.[5] Upon its end, the lockdown was eased in phases.[6]

        According to a report by the federal government, Pakistan could have expected 50,000 cases of the disease by 25
        April.[7][8][9] However, the number by then remained under 13,000, only about a quarter of what was
        expected.[10] , accounting for 27% of cases in the country by late April.[11] Pakistan started vaccine trials in
        collaboration with Sinopharm, a Chinese pharmaceutical company, in April 2020.[12]
        On 26 February, Pakistan confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus. Zafar Mirza, the Prime Minister's
        Special Assistant on Health, stated in a tweet: "I can confirm first two cases of coronavirus in
        Pakistan."[18][19] The first patient was a student at the University of Karachi, Karachi in Sindh province,
        while the second patient was from the federal territory of the country.[20] Both patients had recently returned
        from Iran.[2][21]

        Within a week of the first two cases, Pakistan confirmed three more cases, including a case in Pakistan's
        capital, Islamabad and also in Rawalpindi, Punjab.
        On 11 March 76 suspected cases were reported in several districts of Punjab province, including Lahore,
        Gujranwala, Sargodha, Hafizabad and Lodhran. The Healthcare Department officials informed that ten patients were
        immediately cleared of the suspicion, while 55 patients were cleared after testing negative.[34] A second case
        in Gilgit-Baltistan was confirmed the same day in Skardu leaving the tally at 20.[35] A third case was confirmed
        in Gilgit-Baltistan in Shigar District on 12 March, who had a travel history of Iran and was reported to be
        under treatment at the Skardu hospital.[36] The same day, Murtaza Wahab informed that the second patient of the
        virus had completely recovered.[citation needed] On 13 March, the Sindh Health Department identified a
        52-year-old patient as positive, which marked the first case of local disease transmission as the patient had
        travelled from Islamabad.[37][38] 24 of the 27 suspected cases in Khyber Pakhtunkwa were also cleared that
        day.[39] At the end of the day, the total number of cases had risen to 28, with six new cases in Taftan and
        another in Sindh.[40][41] By 14 March, the number of cases was 31 as two new patients were found positive in
        Karachi while one was reported in Islamabad.[42]

        Five more cases were announced in Karachi the next day on 15 March, including a second local transmission of the
        coronavirus in Sindh, while the other three had a travel history of Saudi Arabia and one had been to
        Balochistan.[43] There was also a new case reported in Islamabad Capital Territory. Lahore Health Secretary,
        Mohammad Usman confirmed the first case of coronavirus in Punjab in the city of Lahore. The infected patient had
        returned from United Kingdom on 10 March and was shifted to Mayo Hospital in an isolation ward.[44] The National
        Institute of Health reported 11 new cases in Sindh and 6 new in a mobile lab at the Taftan border area. and the
        first case in Punjab, increasing the tally to 53.[45][46] On 16 March, a total of 134 new positives cases were
        registered, the majority of them, 116 in Sindh. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also reported its first 15 cases[47] while 3
        were found in Balochistan. This marked the sharpest increase so far as not only were more than a 100 cases were
        reported in a province within a day but also the number across the country reached 187.[48][49][50] The tally
        had shot up to 237 with 25 new cases in Punjab, 12 in Sindh and 4 in Islamabad on 17 March.

    <p> <b> Hundreds of children in Pakistan's Sindh infected with COVID-19</b>
        At least 930 children under 10 in southern province have tested positive for coronavirus, raising concerns amid
        school closures.
        More than 900 children under the age of 10 have so far tested positive for the new coronavirus in Pakistan's
        southern Sindh province, as the country considers reimposing a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the
        contagion.

        Most of the children are asymptomatic and belong to poor families that live in cramped conditions, where
        physical distancing is almost impossible at home.
    </p>
    <h2 id="punjab">punjab</h3>
    <p>The novel coronavirus emerged in the central China city of Wuhan towards the end of last year and proliferated to
        almost the whole world within a couple of months. It’s not the virulence or fatality, but the infectivity of the
        new virus – also known as SARS-CoV-2 – that has set off a global frenzy.

        <b> The COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by this mysterious contagion has so far infected more than a million
            people in 202 countries and territories of the world – more than 55,000 of them have died and counting.</b>

        Pakistan, despite its close proximity with China, remained coronavirus-free until February 26 when a young man
        from Karachi tested positive after returning from Iran – one of the worst-hit countries. After a brief hiatus
        following the first case, COVID-19 cases spiked as more pilgrims returning from Iran tested positive for the
        virus.</p>

    <p>As part of relief assistance and goodwill gesture by the people of Japan to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus
        pandemic in Pakistan, an international Japanese NGO, KnK (Kokkyo naki Kodomotachi, Children without Borders) has
        stepped forward to provide emergency support to the deserving families in Mansehra, which is one of the most
        seriously COVID-19 affected districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) after Peshawar and Mardan.

        <b> This emergency support, provided by KnK on behalf of the Japanese people, has a scale of JPY 711,500 (ca.
            PKR
            1,077,500) and 165 families in target villages of Haripur district have been provided with one-month food
            package along with sanitation kits.</b>
        Besides providing financial support to the vulnerable families in targeted areas, KnK has initiated a hygiene
        awareness campaign among the village communities to sensitize them about the threat of COVID-19 virus and also
        sanitized houses, roads and mosques in the area. School children were also trained on how to better protect
        themselves from the corona virus like practicing hand wash regularly which is an easiest safety precaution
        against this invisible enemy.

        To better equip the medical staff fighting the COVID-19 as a frontline force, KnK also provided Personal
        Protection Equipment (PPE) and other necessary medical equipment through a local Pakistani NGO Friends Welfare
        Association to three hospitals where corona virus patients are being treated. There is no doubt that the Medical
        Staff fighting against the deadly COVID-19 virus is the front-line force and without whom fight against this
        pandemic can never be won.

        While expressing his views on the relief assistance being provided by the Japanese NGO KnK, H.E. MATSUDA
        Kuninori, Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan has said that all of this emergency support is funded by personal
        donations from the people of Japan for the people of Pakistan in this difficult time. “This support shows the
        longstanding friendship between Japan and Pakistan as well as the strong will to stand by those in need to fight
        against COVID-19. I believe that such good-will gestures will continue in the future” emphatically said the
        Ambassador.

        It is pertinent to mention here that earlier this month another international Japanese NGO AAR-Japan has
        distributed relief assistance such as food packages and hygiene kits in the targeted areas of Mansehra district
        to help and support the vulnerable families after the outbreak of COVID-19.

        KnK has been supporting the vulnerable people in Pakistan since 2005. The latest project of KnK is the grant aid
        support of the government of Japan, "The Project for Promoting Girls Education Through Improved Learning
        Environment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" from 2017.

        Friends Welfare Association is proceeding with "The Project for Construction of Primary & Middle School in
        Village Toheedabad, UC Bartooni, Torghar District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" in 2019 with the grant aid support of the
        government of Japan. (END)

    <p>RAWALPINDI/Islamabad: <b></b> At least 125 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Rawalpindi on Thursday, while
        one
        person has died and 29 people have recovered from the disease while in Islamabad three more people have died of
        Covid-19 and 97 new cases have been reported.</b>

        Even as Covid-19 cases continue to escalate, markets and shopping centres are open to shoppers while standard
        operating procedures (SOP) issued to prevent the spread of the coronavirus are not being enforced.

        Action has not been taken against shopping centres or shopkeepers violating these guidelines despite directives
        to this effect from Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar.
    <h3> <a href="#top">top</a> </h3>
    A 62-year-old man who lived on Awan Chowk in Pirwadhai died of Covid-19 on May 21, two days after he was brought
    to Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH).
    As of Thursday, 75 people have died from the disease in Rawalpindi and 606 people have recovered. There have now
    been 1,997 cases in total, of which 1,316 patients are still receiving treatment - 412 in hospitals and 904 in
    isolation at home.

    Another 512 suspected patients have been brought to Rawalpindi’s three hospitals and their samples have been
    sent to the National Institute of Health and the BBH laboratory. The results will take three to four days.

    The number of cases reported in Rawalpindi has been rising in comparison to those reported in the neighbouring
    three districts of Attock, Jhelum and Chakwal. Four patients were reported from all three districts on Thursday
    - one in Attock and three in Chakwal - while Rawalpindi district reported 125.

    Commissioner retired Capt Mohammad Mehmood told Dawn that a new notification has been issued allowing markets
    and shops to stay open until 10pm.

    He said the longer shopping hours aimed to reduce crowding in markets, as many people visit markets in the
    morning and some would visit at night.
    <h3> <a href="#top">top</a> </h3>
    He said the Punjab government has directed district administrations across the province to implement SOPs in
    markets, mosques and imambargahs in the last few days of Ramazan.

    He said people need to be made aware about the need for safety measures, as the World Health Organisation has
    warned that people will have to live with the coronavirus in the near future. He said people need to change
    their lifestyles and take precautions to protect themselves and their families.

    Mr Mehmood said the number of Covid-19 patients is increasing in Rawalpindi, and people have to take precautions
    and avoid leaving their homes.

    He added that the government-run hospitals have enough kits to test suspected Covid-19 patients. There are 5,056
    kits available in the four districts of Rawalpindi, including 800 in Rawalpindi, 1,581 in Attock, 791 in Jhelum
    and 1,884 in Chakwal.

    Three deaths, 97 new cases in capital

    Three more people have died of Covid-19 in Islamabad and 97 new cases have been reported.

    Capital administration and hospital officials said 12 Covid-19 patients who were residents of Islamabad have
    died so far.

    On Thursday, two deaths were reported from Alipur and Tarlai, and a patient died at the Pakistan Institute of
    Medical Sciences (Pims) whose address is not known.

    Another 55 patients who were residents of other districts have also died at various Islamabad hospitals, they
    said. Most of the deceased patients had other conditions as well, such as diabetes, asthma, blood pressure and
    cardiac or kidney disease.
